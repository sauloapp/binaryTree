# binaryTree
A not balanced non-recursive Java binary search tree inspired by the Sedgewick's implementation as presented in his "Algorithms" books (mainly Algorithms in C, 1990).
The BinaryTree only provides only  initialization (constructor) and insertion as public methods to manipulate. The "in order" traversal is used to sort the elements of the tree out to an sorted array of CounterObjects.

Each node stores, in the minimum, the number of occurrences of the object (a CounterObject) being represented for a given application.

Besides, Sedgewick implementation of the QuickSort is available in the BinaryTree class only to someone play with it comparing performances...
